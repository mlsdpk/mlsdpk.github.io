I am currently pursuing my PhD in Robotics at the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/), working with [Professor Jonathan Kelly](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/20331-jonathan-kelly) in the [STARS Laboratory](https://starslab.ca). My research explores ideas from differential geometry to advance motion planning and task-level behaviors, making robots move and act more intelligently and efficiently.

Previously, I worked in robotics at [Dyson](https://careers.dyson.com/en-gb/what-you-can-do/engineer/robotics/) and [LionsBot International](https://www.lionsbot.com), where I contributed to many autonomy software stacks and large-scale robotic deployments. I also conducted research at the ROAR Lab, [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg) under [Professor Mohan Rajesh Elara](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/profile/mohan-rajesh-elara/), and earlier studied Mechatronics Engineering at [Yangon Technological University](https://ytuedu.org), where I worked under Professor Theint Theint Thu. I hold a first-class honours degree in Electronic Engineering from the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk).
