I'm a senior software engineer at an amazing company called <a href="https://www.lionsbot.com">LionsBot International</a>, developing high-performance autonomy systems for autonomous cleaning robots. With a focus on cutting-edge technology and delivering exceptional results, I also ensure our team follows coding best practices and provide guidance for their professional growth. At LionsBot, we deploy thousands of robots globally and I'm proud to be part of this innovative work.

I began my mechatronic engineering degree at Yangon Technological University, Myanmar in 2014 with an expected graduation in 2020. However, due to the COVID pandemic and political events, I have yet to complete my studies. During my final year, I had the opportunity to intern at the Robotics and Automation Research (ROAR) Laboratory at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the supervision of Prof. Mohan Rajesh Elara where I collaborated with others to publish research articles in robotics, computer vision, and path planning. I also worked on autonomous service robots and developed their planning and control systems (See <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robots-for-cleaning-floors-disinfecting-lift-panels-among-technologies-being-tested-at">post from the Straits Times</a> where we showcased the capabilities of our service robots at Singapore food courts).

I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others. I give talks, hold workshops, and mentor students in Myanmar. In 2017, I was chosen to lead the team representing my country Myanmar at the First Global Challenge 2017 and achieved rank 6th out of 163 teams.
